	- re-added deleting batterystats.bin as an option (off by default)
	- moved all preferences to the settings screen
	- added an option to turn charging on or off, and also an option
	  to automatically turn charging off when USB power detected
	- added some heuristics to determine when the battery is done
	  charging, hopefully it works
	- bugfixes, general code cleanup

	  power detected

	  (which hopefully works)
	- fix for busybox that has the 'ash' applet instead of 'sh'

	  (https://github.com/ravilov/AtrixBatteryFix)


0.1 FINAL
	- mostly just cosmetic changes


0.1-beta4
	- instead of running hardcoded shell commands, now runs external shell
	  scripts in the app's datadir (so you can modify the scripts to your own
	  liking)
	- all shell commands/scripts are now executed through busybox instead of
	  default system shell (so busybox is now required)
	- separated fixing the battd datafiles (which is normally needed every so
	  often) from fixing battd permissions and ownership (which should be
	  needed only once)
	- cleanup and other improvements
