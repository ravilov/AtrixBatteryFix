0.1 FINAL
	- mostly just cosmetic changes


0.1-beta4
	- instead of running hardcoded shell commands, now runs external shell
	  scripts in the app's datadir (so you can modify the scripts to your own
	  liking)
	- all shell commands/scripts are now executed through busybox instead of
	  default system shell (so busybox is now required)
	- separated fixing the battd datafiles (which is normally needed every so
	  often) from fixing battd permissions and ownership (which should be
	  needed only once)
	- cleanup and other improvements


0.1-beta3
	- run fix and recalibration right before auto-reboot too, just in case


0.1-beta2
	- added deleting batterystats.bin
	- added fixing ownership and permissions of battd and friends
	- cleaned up the "about" and "licence" texts
	- possibly other fixes and improvements I forgot about


0.1-beta1
	- hopefully fixed the reboot-when-charged issue


0.1-alpha3
	- fixed some bugs that caused issues on ICS and newer
	- cleaned up the checkbox logic
	- slightly improved the UI
	- other minor fixes and improvements


0.1-alpha2
