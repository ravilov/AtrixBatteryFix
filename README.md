AtrixBatteryFix
===============
This app helps fix the common "battery won't charge beyond xx%" bug that seems to affect most Motorola Atrix phones.
In addition, this app deletes the "batterystats.bin" file, thus forcing battery recalibration. It also attempts to fix ownership and permissions of the "battd" daemon and its data and config files.
