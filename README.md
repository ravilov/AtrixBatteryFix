AtrixBatteryFix
===============
This app helps fix the common "battery won't charge beyond xx%" bug that seems to affect most Motorola Atrix phones.
It also attempts to fix ownership and permissions of the "battd" daemon and its data and config files.
Optionally, this app can also delete the "batterystats.bin" file, thus forcing battery recalibration.
In addition, this app can enable/disable charging (on compatible kernels) and also be set up to automatically disable charging when an USB connection is detected.
